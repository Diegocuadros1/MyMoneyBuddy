# My Money Buddy: Financial Assistant
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/ekNsAsgRCls
#### Description: My Money Buddy Financial Assistant is a web application that is for those who need assistance in saving their own money and being able to calculate their finances best.

I thought about this idea because a while ago, I learned a lot about how important it is to save in a job and be able to manage your money well, and I tried to look for an app to be able to help me manage my money, but every app costs money and is very complicated, and I have been messaging myself my own expenses and income to be able to manage my money. I decided it would be better off if I made my own website so that I could manage my own money and maybe others could use it as well, and be influenced to manage their money as well.

The web application has a login page where you can either log in or register by putting your username and password. Once you are registered, you will be prompted two starting questions, what is the amount of money you are starting off with, and how much would you like to put into savings. By adding a percent into your savings,  for every new income that you recieve, whether it be work, or a job, will be automatically taken and added to ur savings, and not adding it to your total amount of money.

The homepage displays a graph of your expenses, however without anything in it, the graph will be empty. As you add your expenses, more bars on the graph will appear, and your graph will tell you which of your expenses are most dominant and which ones are less. On the left, it will show you how much is your total, and how much you have saved, and how much you spent on your most spent category. Lastly, there is a button on the bottom where if you press it, it will change the graph and make it say how much money in actual dollar amount instead of percent it is.

In the tab called update expenses, there is a form you can fill out where you can fill in an expense or a gain that you have completed. If you have an expense, it will be subtracted from your total and it will be added to the graph. If there is a gain, then a percent (however much you have added to the savings) will be subtracted from that and added to the savings, while the rest will be added to the total.

Next tab is history, where it shows every expense or gain submitted with the date, description, category and price.

Next tab is savings, where you are able to change the amount of savings on your income, so it can either increase more or less. It also informs you about how much you have saved and the percent it is saving at.

In search, you can look up any category that you have submitted in the update expenses tab, and it will look similar to history.

Lastly, Logout will take you to the register and login page.

This web application uses Flask and is run on Python. HTML and CSS was used to create the website and Javascript was used slightly to help with the website asthetics and the graph.

Some improvements that I would do to this web application would be to add more to the graph and be able to adjust the amount in which the graphs are displayed. Some long term ideas could be to add more budgeting services, like it would tell you how much you should spend on food for a month, subtracting how much rent and giving you how much you should spend on different things.
